Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project

Objective: To analyze credit card transaction patterns, spending behavior, and card performance across customer demographics and job types using Power BI’s interactive visualization and DAX modeling.

I designed & published a Power BI dashboard to monitor revenue (₹55M), interest earned (₹8M), and transaction volume (656K) across multiple dimensions like job type, education, and expenditure category — enabling data-driven insights for financial institutions.

Key Insights:
• Total Transactions: 656K | Revenue: ₹55M | Interest Earned: ₹8M | Transaction Value: ₹45M
• Swipe transactions generated the highest revenue (₹35M), followed by Chip (₹17M).
• Blue card category leads with ₹46M revenue and ~70% of total transaction value.
• Q3 recorded the highest revenue (₹14.2M) and peak transaction count (166K) — indicating festive season activity.
• Major spending categories: Bills (₹14M), Entertainment (₹10M), and Fuel (₹9M) — covering over 60% of total expenditure.
• Graduates (₹22M) and High School users (₹11M) drive the largest revenue share by education.
• Businessmen and white-collar professionals are top contributors by job segment.

Tools & Techniques Used:
• Power BI (Data Modeling, Power Query, DAX)
• KPI Cards, Bar & Tree Map Visuals
• Interactive Filters for Card Category, Gender & Quarter
• Performance comparison using QTR-level trend analysis
